            <h1>About Fiji</h1>
                <p>We have all seen them, the alluring pictures of white beaches with a turquoise sea meeting a
                    cloudless blue sky. Perhaps a few exotic palms offering shade to a couple of large, sedentary turtles.
                    It looks like the perfect place for the holiday of our dreams. 
                    In fact, Fiji has far more to offer than picture perfect postcards.
                    Here are some things you didn't know about Fiji!
                </p>
            <h1>Fiji facts</h1>
                <p>Fiji is a South Pacific archipelago, about 2,000 km from New Zealand, with roughly 300 volcanic islands and over 500 smaller islets.<br> The main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, house most of Fiji’s nearly one million people, with the capital, Suva, located on Viti Levu. Fiji’s climate is tropical marine, with a wet season (November to April) and a dry season (May to October), occasionally affected by cyclones.<br><br> Isolated from other lands, Fiji hosts unique plant and animal species, with rainforests covering about half its landmass and rich marine ecosystems. Settled from Taiwan thousands of years ago, Fiji became a British colony in 1874 and achieved independence in 1970.
